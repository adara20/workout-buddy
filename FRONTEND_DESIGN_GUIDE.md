# Frontend Design Philosophy & Guidelines

This document outlines the core design principles for the Workout Buddy project, based on the Anthropics Frontend Design Skill.

## Core Philosophy
- **Production-Grade Interfaces:** Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.
- **Bold Aesthetic Direction:** Commit to a clear, intentional aesthetic (e.g., industrial/utilitarian, brutally minimal).
- **Unforgettable Differentiation:** Focus on what makes the interface memorable and unique.
- **Intentionality over Intensity:** Whether minimalist or maximalist, every choice must be intentional.

## Key Rules
- **Production-grade and functional:** The code must be robust and work as intended.
- **Visually striking and memorable:** The interface should leave a lasting impression.
- **Cohesive Point-of-View:** All design elements must align with the chosen aesthetic.
- **Meticulous Detail:** Precision and attention to subtle details are paramount.

## Technical Guidelines
- **Typography:** Use distinctive display fonts paired with refined body fonts. Avoid generic system fonts.
- **Color & Theme:** Use cohesive palettes with CSS variables. Prefer dominant colors with sharp accents.
- **Motion:** Prioritize CSS-only animations for micro-interactions and high-impact moments (staggered reveals, scroll triggers).
- **Spatial Composition:** Employ unexpected layouts, asymmetry, or controlled density.
- **Visual Texture:** Create depth with noise textures, geometric patterns, or layered transparencies.

## What to AVOID
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics.
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, etc.).
- Cliched color schemes (e.g., purple gradients).
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter component patterns.
